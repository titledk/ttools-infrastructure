Helpers for using Terminal Tools to manage your infrastructure

For now there's not much here - [contact us](http://title.dk/contact/) if you're curious on
how you can use this to manage your infrastructure.

## Installation

	git submodule add https://github.com/titledk/ttools-infrastructure.git ttools/infrastructure; ./ttools/infrastructure/install/install.sh;


## Collect environments

_Collects all servers and sites defined in all terminal tools configurations available locally_

This is thought to be sent to a servers and sites database.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

	php ./ttools/infrastructure/lib/collect-environments.php
